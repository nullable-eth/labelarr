#### Persistent Storage

- ✅ Added persistent storage for processed items

  - Validates API token before processing begins
  - Provides clear error messages for authentication failures
  - Shows detailed error responses for debugging

- ✅ Improved error handling throughout
  - Better error messages for TMDb API failures
  - Clear indication of authentication vs other errors
  - Verbose mode shows why items are skipped

### Changed

- Modified `NewProcessor` to accept optional Radarr/Sonarr clients and return error
- Enhanced TMDb ID detection to show source (Plex metadata, Radarr, Sonarr, or file path)
- Processor initialization now includes persistent storage setup
- Main application now tests all API connections on startup

### Documentation

- ✅ Updated README.md with comprehensive documentation
  - Added Radarr/Sonarr Integration section with benefits and configuration
  - Added Verbose Logging section with examples
  - Updated environment variables documentation
  - Added persistent storage information
  - Updated docker-compose examples

- ✅ Created detailed CHANGELOG.md
  - Comprehensive list of all changes
  - Organized by feature area
  - Technical implementation details

#### Keyword Normalization

- ✅ Added intelligent keyword normalization feature
  - Automatically normalizes TMDb keywords for consistent formatting
  - Pattern-based recognition for dynamic handling without hardcoding
  - Smart title casing with proper article and preposition handling
  - Automatic duplicate removal after normalization

- ✅ Pattern Recognition Features
  - **Critical Replacements**: Known abbreviations (sci-fi → Sci-Fi, romcom → Romantic Comedy)
  - **Acronym Detection**: Automatically uppercases known acronyms (FBI, CIA, DEA, etc.)
  - **Agency Patterns**: Detects agency roles (dea agent → DEA Agent)
  - **Parenthetical Acronyms**: Handles acronyms in parentheses (central intelligence agency (cia) → Central Intelligence Agency (CIA))
  - **Century Patterns**: Properly formats centuries (5th century bc → 5th Century BC)
  - **City/State Patterns**: Handles location formatting (san francisco, california → San Francisco, California)
  - **Relationship Patterns**: Adds "Relationship" where appropriate (father daughter → Father Daughter Relationship)
  - **Credit Stinger Terms**: Expands compound terms (duringcreditsstinger → During Credits Stinger)

- ✅ Added comprehensive test suite
  - 90+ test cases covering various normalization scenarios
  - Tests for edge cases, mixed case preservation, and pattern matching
  - Ensures consistent behavior across different keyword types

- ✅ Smart duplicate cleaning functionality
  - Automatically removes old unnormalized keywords when adding normalized versions
  - Preserves manually set keywords in Plex
  - Prevents accumulation of duplicate keywords (e.g., both "sci-fi" and "Sci-Fi")
  - Shows cleaning activity in verbose logging mode

#### Force Update Mode

- ✅ Added force update functionality
  - New `FORCE_UPDATE` environment variable (default: false)
  - Reprocesses all items regardless of previous processing status
  - Useful for applying keyword normalization to existing libraries
  - Shows clear indication when force update mode is active
  - Bypasses both storage checks and "already has keywords" logic

### Changed

- Modified `NewProcessor` to accept optional Radarr/Sonarr clients and return error
- Enhanced TMDb ID detection to show source (Plex metadata, Radarr, Sonarr, or file path)
- Processor initialization now includes persistent storage setup
- Main application now tests all API connections on startup
- TMDb client now normalizes all keywords before returning them
- Updated keyword display to show normalization in verbose mode
- Enhanced keyword synchronization with smart duplicate cleaning
- Force update mode bypasses all previous processing checks

### Documentation
